.. FasterProfileGen
.. =================

.. This module is a temporary module, used to build up the essential codebase 
.. before transitioning to a more organized structure.
.. As can be seen, the module has become quite unreadable; improvements to be made
.. in the upcoming RietveldPhase project.

Rietveld Phases Module
======================

This module is built to replace FasterProfileGen, in a way that is both more 
versatile and more accommodating of multi-phase powder diffraction profiles.
